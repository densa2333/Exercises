# 04-æ ‘5_Root_of_AVL_Tree

## Description

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Figures 1-4 illustrate the rotation rules.

Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to tell the root of the resulting AVL tree.
